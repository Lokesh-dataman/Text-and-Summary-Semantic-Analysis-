This is a Semantic Similarity Analysis for a text paragraph and the summary for it. 
We have used three models for finding out the semantic similarity ratio ( 0 to 1) betwwen the text and the summary.
The three models used are- 

1) Similarity using spaCy 
2) Corpora Based Similarity
3) Textual Similarity using Pytorch and SentenceTransformers
